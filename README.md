## How to publish this portfolio

This README is ready to be published with GitHub Pages or used as the content for a static portfolio site.

Options:

- GitHub Pages (README site): In your repository Settings → Pages, select the `main` branch (root) or `docs/` folder and enable Pages. The `README.md` will be shown as the project home.
- Vercel (recommended for Next.js projects): Connect your repository to Vercel for automatic builds and HTTPS.

If you'd like this converted into a full Next.js + Tailwind portfolio with pages, routing, and a deploy pipeline, I can scaffold it here (site, demo content, GitHub Actions / Vercel config).
